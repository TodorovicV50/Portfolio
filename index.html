                    <p>Early on, I realized that technology doesn’t just interest me—it inspires me. For me, developing is more than writing code; it’s the ability to bring ideas to life and solve problems creatively. Every project, no matter how small, feels like a new adventure where I can learn something new.The combination of logic, creativity, and the satisfaction of building something from scratch is what drives me. That’s why I am a developer at heart—because every day gives me the chance to make the world a little better, smarter, or simply more enjoyable.</p>

                <h2><span class="text-highlighted">A few words </span>about Dominik Todorovic</h2>
                <p>In September 2025, a completely new chapter began for me: I decided to learn how to program. Not because I suddenly had plenty of free time—quite the opposite. I work full-time, I’m a brand-new dad, and I still make time for my hobby, bodybuilding. But despite all these responsibilities, I felt a growing desire to build something new, something that could open doors for my future.So I started. After work, when the house finally quieted down and my baby was asleep, I sat down at my laptop. Sometimes tired, sometimes exhausted, but always determined. Instead of watching series or going straight to bed, I dove into the world of YouTube tutorials, online courses, and programming websites. Step by step, I learned how to write code, how to build websites, and how an idea can turn into something real.It wasn’t always easy—but that’s exactly what made it exciting. Every small step felt like a personal victory. Every bug I fixed was proof that with discipline and passion, you can learn something completely new even under the toughest conditions.Today, I look back on that time with pride. Because I proved to myself that you don’t need perfect circumstances to start. Even in the middle of chaos—between diapers, work shifts, and dumbbells—you can begin your journey as a developer. And that journey has shaped who I am today: someone who never stops learning and believes that true passion has no bedtime.</p>
